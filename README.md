# Spam-Email-classification
Spam Email Classification
## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam. Email spam classification is a crucial task for improving email security and reducing the clutter in users' inboxes.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the email dataset to handle missing values, remove irrelevant features, and convert categorical data into numerical format.
Feature Engineering: Extracted features from the email content, such as word frequency, presence of special characters, and email metadata.
Model Training: Used various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to train the spam classification model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The Random Forest model provided the best results with a high accuracy and balanced precision-recall tradeoff.
Visualization: Visualized the performance metrics and feature importance to understand the model's decision-making process.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub
### Key Highlights
Achieved an accuracy of over 95% with the Random Forest model.
Implemented data preprocessing techniques to improve model performance and generalizability.
Conducted thorough feature engineering to enhance the model's ability to differentiate between spam and non-spam emails.
